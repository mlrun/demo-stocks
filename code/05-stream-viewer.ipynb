(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc s  Google aims to power its data centers and offices using solely carbon-free electricity by 2030, its chief executive told Reuters, building on its previous goal of matching its energy use with 100% renewable energy.\\\\nThe \\\\\"stretch goal,\\\\\" as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, will force Google to move beyond the tech industry norm of offsetting carbon emissions from electricity use and require technological and political breakthroughs to achieve.\\\\n\\\\\"The problem is so immense, many of us need to lead the way and show solutions,\\\\\" Pichai said. \\\\\"We\\\\u2019re one small player in this but we can set an example.\\\\\"\\\\nWildfires burning a record area in the western United States this month have increased public awareness of climate change, Pichai said, and Google wants to bring further attention through its new goal as well as product features.\\\\nWind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for 61% of Google s global hourly electricity usage last year. The proportion varied by facility, with carbon-free sources fulfilling 96% of hourly power needs at Google s wind-swept Oklahoma data center compared with 3% at its gas-reliant Singapore operation. \\\\nBut Google, which consumes slightly more power annually worldwide than residents and businesses in Delaware, has grown optimistic that it can bridge the gap with batteries to store solar power overnight, emerging sources such as geothermal reservoirs and better management of power needs.\\\\n\\\\\"To plan 24/7 hourly being carbon-free in our data centers and campuses around the world, we see an enormous logistics challenge, which is why we ve been hard at work modeling the last year how to get there,\\\\\" Pichai said. \\\\\"And we feel confident we can get there by 2030.\\\\\"\\\\nHe declined to share the likely cost of achieving the goal.\\\\nBig Google rivals including  Microsoft Corp   and Amazon.com Inc  have targeted removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit over the coming decades, but none of them have publicly set a goal to stop sourcing carbon-based energy.\\\\nBut the companies share a common goal of catalyzing businesses and governments to curb climate pollution before 2030, when scientists say global warming could become catastrophic if unchecked.\\\\nJennifer Layke, global director at research group World Resources Institute, which has received Google funding, said the company inspired others in the United States and Europe over the last decade but its efforts must now spur action in crucial polluting regions such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\\"If we can t shift from carbon, we will suffer the firestorms and the droughts,\\\\\" she said. \\\\nGoogle has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions. It also said Monday that its estimated 1 million metric tons of emissions between 2006 and its 1998 launch now have been offset.\\\\nThe company s new goals include bringing 5 gigawatts of renewable energy near some suppliers, funding tree planting beyond its offset needs and sharing data or forging partnerships with 500 governments around the world to try to cut 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030.\\\\nGoogle said it would continue to offset carbon emissions unrelated to electricity use, such as from employee travel.\\\\nIts carbon-free electricity goal satisfies one demand of 2,000 Google employees who last November petitioned the company to stop selling data storage and other cloud computing tools to oil companies and funding think tanks or politicians who deny the existence of climate change.\\\\nOn Monday, several employees who signed the petition said Google risks undermining its new goals if it keeps supporting customers and politicians exacerbating global warming.\\\\n\\\\\"Today s announcement is a step in the right direction, but the urgency of the situation demands more,\\\\\" employees said in a statement.\\\\n\\\\nPichai said Google would continue to \\\\\"support everyone\\\\\" with its cloud services and help oil and gas companies transition to tapping other sources.\", \"time\": \"2020-09-14 00:00:00\", \"symbol\": \"GOOGL\", \"link\": \"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/google-sets-unprecedented-goal-to-tap-only-renewable-power-by-2030-2294328\", \"sentiment\": -0.09523809523809523}, {\"content\": \"By William Schomberg and David Milliken\\\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain s unemployment rate rose for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown began in March, sending a warning signal ahead of an expected surge in job losses when a huge government job subsidy programme expires next month.\\\\nThe unemployment rate increased to 4.1% in the three months to July from the 3.9% it had clung to since early 2020, in line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.\\\\nThe government s coronavirus job subsidy scheme has shielded millions of workers and there were fewer job losses than feared in the figures published on Tuesday.\\\\nRedundancies increased by 48,000 on the quarter to 156,000, the biggest rise in over 10 years, but the level remained well below that seen during the 2008 downturn.\\\\nSamuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said job losses were likely to accelerate in September and October when employers will have to pay more towards the cost of the furlough scheme.\\\\n\\\\\"The number of people searching on Google  for phrases including  redundancy  rocketed to a record high in July, consistent on past form with the official measure of redundancies peaking in September,\\\\\" he said.\\\\nA single-month estimate for the unemployment rate - which is more timely but less representative than the three-month data - jumped to 4.4% in July and an experimental weekly estimate hit 4.8% in the last week of the month.\\\\nSeparate tax office data showed the number of staff on company payrolls fell by a monthly 36,000 in August. \\\\nThat was more than job losses of 20,000 in July but still only a fraction of mass layoffs in April and May.

Apple also introduced the Apple Fitness+ service, powered by its watches, that will deliver virtual workouts for $10 per month or $80 per year and be available before the end of the year.\\\\nApple s fitness service puts it closer to competition with Peloton Interactive  Inc , which makes connected exercise gear and sells subscriptions to online fitness classes. Apple said that most of its workouts were designed to be conducted with either no equipment or minimal gear such as a set of dumbbells. Peloton s workouts typically require either a bike or a treadmill. Shares of Peloton pared back early gains after the Apple event and were up about 2% in late trade.\\\\nThe ability of the Apple Watch to monitor blood oxygen seeks to beat a similar feature already available on watches from rival Fitbit  Inc, which Alphabet  Inc s Google is buying for $2.1 billion. Apple said its watch will be able to take absolute blood oxygen measurements on-demand while the user is still, while Fitbit s devices currently show either variations in blood oxygen levels or a set of measurements taken while the user is sleeping.\\\\nApple also for the first time offered a way to use an Apple Watch without pairing it one-to-one with an iPhone, offering what it calls \\\\\"Family Setup.\\\\\" Watches with an LTE connection can be set up on one iPhone but then used independently by a family member, for example to keep tabs on an aging parent or a child.\\\\nBob O\\\\u2019Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, said watches for children have become a huge business in China, though models there are usually much lower cost than even the most basic Apple Watch.\\\\nFASTER IPAD CHIP\\\\nApple added a faster chip to its base model iPad, which it priced at $329 for consumers and $299 for education customers. Apple s new iPad Air will cost $599 and look more like its iPad Pro models and a new A14 processor chip that Apple says will be the first to use a 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process. \\\\nAn update of Apple s biggest seller - the iPhone - is expected to be announced next month after executives have said its launch will be delayed by several weeks because of pandemic-related disruptions.\\\\nApple said the Series 6 watch s ability to monitor blood oxygen using infrared light should be used for fitness and wellness purposes. Apple said flu investigators in Washington state will study heart rate and blood oxygen data from Apple Watch for potential early signs of respiratory conditions like influenza and COVID-19. \\\\nDoctors in India and other countries have used pulse oximeters to remotely check on COVID-19 patients and ensure their oxygen saturation level does not fall too low.\\\\nApple shares  have soared this year even as the virus has crippled economies around the world, thanks in large part to booming sales of work-from-home items. \\\\nApple shares gave up gains to trade flat on Tuesday after climbing more than 50% for the year, well ahead of the 23% gain for the Nasdaq.

The proportion varied by facility, with carbon-free sources fulfilling 96% of hourly power needs at Google s wind-swept Oklahoma data center compared with 3% at its gas-reliant Singapore operation. \\nBut Google, which consumes slightly more power annually worldwide than residents and businesses in Delaware, has grown optimistic that it can bridge the gap with batteries to store solar power overnight, emerging sources such as geothermal reservoirs and better management of power needs.\\n\\\"To plan 24/7 hourly being carbon-free in our data centers and campuses around the world, we see an enormous logistics challenge, which is why we ve been hard at work modeling the last year how to get there,\\\" Pichai said. \\\"And we feel confident we can get there by 2030.\\\"\\nHe declined to share the likely cost of achieving the goal.\\nBig Google rivals including  Microsoft Corp   and Amazon.com Inc  have targeted removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit over the coming decades, but none of them have publicly set a goal to stop sourcing carbon-based energy.\\nBut the companies share a common goal of catalyzing businesses and governments to curb climate pollution before 2030, when scientists say global warming could become catastrophic if unchecked.\\nJennifer Layke, global director at research group World Resources Institute, which has received Google funding, said the company inspired others in the United States and Europe over the last decade but its efforts must now spur action in crucial polluting regions such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.\\n\\\"If we can t shift from carbon, we will suffer the firestorms and the droughts,\\\" she said. \\nGoogle has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions.

The southern one will pass between the Step Pyramid of Saqqara - the oldest one - and the Dahshur area, home to the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid.\\nEach highway appears to be about eight lanes wide.\\nCritics say they could cause irrevocable damage to one of the world s most important heritage sites. Authorities say they will be built with care and improve transport links, connecting new urban developments and bypassing central Cairo s congestion.\\n\\\"The roads are very, very important for development, for Egyptians, for inside Egypt,\\\" said Mostafa al-Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt s Supreme Council of Antiquities. \\\"Know that we take good care of our antiquities sites everywhere in Egypt.\\\"\\nSome Egyptologists and conservationists say the highways will disrupt the integrity of the pyramids plateau, pave over unexplored archaeological sites, generate pollution that could corrode monuments, produce litter and expose closed areas packed with hidden archaeological treasures to looting.\\nAl-Waziri said existing roads were much closer to the pyramids and carried a lot of tourist buses. \\\"That is why we are doing a lot of development,\\\" he said, noting plans to use electric tourist buses within the plateau to avoid pollution.\\nMEMPHIS\\nThe highways, which will dissect the plateau into three, will cross a section of ancient Memphis, one of the world s biggest and most influential cities for almost 3,000 years.\\n\\\"I was flabbergasted by what I saw,\\\" said former senior UNESCO official Said Zulficar, who visited a portion of the southern highway two months ago. \\\"All the work that I had done nearly 25 years ago is now being put into question.\\\"\\nZulficar led a successful campaign in the mid 1990s to suspend construction of the northern highway, a branch of Cairo s first ringroad. UNESCO said it had requested detailed information on the new plan several times and asked to send a monitoring mission.\\nThe state press centre referred a Reuters request for further comment on the plans to a communications advisor of the tourism and antiquities ministry, who could not be reached.\\nConstruction began well over a year ago in desert areas largely out of public sight and became more visible around March, Egyptologists and Google  Earth images indicate.\\nOn a recent visit, Reuters journalists saw heavy machinery clearing fields and building bridges and junctions along both highways. Hundreds of uprooted date palms lay in piles. \\nThe southern highway is a part of Cairo s second ringroad that will connect the western satellite city of Sixth of October to the new capital city east of Cairo via 16 km of desert on the pyramids plateau, farmland and a corner of Memphis.\\nIn 2014, the World Bank estimated congestion in the greater Cairo area cut about 3.6 percentage points off Egypt\\u2019s output.\\n\\\"The road cuts through archaeologically unexplored cemeteries of the little-known 13th Dynasty, in walking distance of the pyramids of Pepi II and Khendjer and the Mastabat el-Fara un\\\", said an Egyptologist who knows the area.\\nThe person was among six Egyptologists Reuters spoke to.

Apple also introduced the Apple Fitness+ service, powered by its watches, that will deliver virtual workouts for $10 per month or $80 per year and be available before the end of the year.\\nApple s fitness service puts it closer to competition with Peloton Interactive  Inc , which makes connected exercise gear and sells subscriptions to online fitness classes. Apple said that most of its workouts were designed to be conducted with either no equipment or minimal gear such as a set of dumbbells. Peloton s workouts typically require either a bike or a treadmill. Shares of Peloton pared back early gains after the Apple event and were up about 2% in late trade.\\nThe ability of the Apple Watch to monitor blood oxygen seeks to beat a similar feature already available on watches from rival Fitbit  Inc, which Alphabet  Inc s Google is buying for $2.1 billion. Apple said its watch will be able to take absolute blood oxygen measurements on-demand while the user is still, while Fitbit s devices currently show either variations in blood oxygen levels or a set of measurements taken while the user is sleeping.\\nApple also for the first time offered a way to use an Apple Watch without pairing it one-to-one with an iPhone, offering what it calls \\\"Family Setup.\\\" Watches with an LTE connection can be set up on one iPhone but then used independently by a family member, for example to keep tabs on an aging parent or a child.\\nBob O\\u2019Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, said watches for children have become a huge business in China, though models there are usually much lower cost than even the most basic Apple Watch.\\nFASTER IPAD CHIP\\nApple added a faster chip to its base model iPad, which it priced at $329 for consumers and $299 for education customers. Apple s new iPad Air will cost $599 and look more like its iPad Pro models and a new A14 processor chip that Apple says will be the first to use a 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process. \\nAn update of Apple s biggest seller - the iPhone - is expected to be announced next month after executives have said its launch will be delayed by several weeks because of pandemic-related disruptions.\\nApple said the Series 6 watch s ability to monitor blood oxygen using infrared light should be used for fitness and wellness purposes. Apple said flu investigators in Washington state will study heart rate and blood oxygen data from Apple Watch for potential early signs of respiratory conditions like influenza and COVID-19. \\nDoctors in India and other countries have used pulse oximeters to remotely check on COVID-19 patients and ensure their oxygen saturation level does not fall too low.\\nApple shares  have soared this year even as the virus has crippled economies around the world, thanks in large part to booming sales of work-from-home items. \\nApple shares gave up gains to trade flat on Tuesday after climbing more than 50% for the year, well ahead of the 23% gain for the Nasdaq.
