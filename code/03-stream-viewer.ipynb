Around 300 subsea cables form the backbone of the internet, carrying 99% of the world’s data traffic.\\nStarks said the FCC \"must ensure that adversary countries and other hostile actors can’t tamper with, block, or intercept the communications they carry.\"\\nIn April, the FCC approved Alphabet Inc unit Google s  request to use part of an U.S.-Asia undersea telecommunications cable, but not to Hong Kong, after U.S. agencies raised national security concerns.\\nGoogle agreed to operate a portion of the 8,000-mile Pacific Light Cable Network System between the United States and Taiwan, but not Hong Kong. Google and Facebook  helped pay for construction of the completed link but U.S. regulators blocked its use.\\nThe companies in August abandoned the proposal to use the Hong Kong portion. A Facebook affiliate has sought FCC approval to use a portion of the cable connecting the Philippines and United States.\\nStarks noted that on Sept 10, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc  and China Mobile (HK:0941) withdrew their application to connect San Francisco and Hong Kong as part of the Bay to Bay Express Cable System.\\nThe companies told the FCC they would work to secure a license \"for a reconfigured system\" acceptable to the Trump administration.\\nThe FCC in April denied China Mobile  s application to operate in the United States. \"The concerns aren’t just about the landing sites of the cables but who owns and operates them,\" Starks added.\\n\\nThe FCC said in April it might shut down U.S. operations of three state-controlled Chinese telecommunications companies -- China Telecom  Americas, China Unicom  Americas, Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet (USA) LLC. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai declined to say Wednesday when the commission may take action.'],\n",

Bolsonaro openly admires Trump and has sought to ally Brazil with the Trump administration, with the two leaders seeking to deepen trade ties.\\nIn Tuesday s heated debate, Biden said Brazil provided an example of how Trump \"has no relationship with foreign policy.\"\\n\"The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down,\" Biden said.\\n\"I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say,  Here s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest.

Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles reacted on Twitter to Biden s offer of funding, writing: \"Just one question: Biden s $20 billion in aid, is that yearly?\".\\nBolsonaro ended his statement in English by calling Joe Biden by the wrong first name.\\n\\n\"What a shame, Mr. John Biden!

       "    'By Foo Yun Chee\\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet  unit Google, Facebook , Amazon , Apple  and other U.S. tech giants could be banned from favouring their services or forcing users to sign up to a bundle of services under draft EU rules aimed at reining in their power.\\nThe draft rules, known as the Digital Services Act, aim to set the ground rules for data-sharing and how digital marketplaces operate. They are expected to come into force by the end of the year.\\nThe European Commission is taking a tough line against U.S. tech giants, driven in part by antitrust cases resulting in decisions that subsequently failed to boost competition because of the lengthy process that typically takes several years.\\nThe case has taken on urgency because of the dependence of thousands of EU companies on the tech giants for their business.\\nGatekeepers, such as companies with bottleneck power or strategic market status, will not be allowed to use data collected on their platforms to target users unless this data is shared with rivals, according to the document seen by Reuters. \\n\"Gatekeepers shall not pre-install exclusively their own applications nor require from any third party operating system developers or hardware manufacturers to pre-install exclusively gatekeepers  own application,\" the paper said.\\nAnother clause would ban gatekeepers from blocking rivals offering their products to customers outside of the gatekeeper s platform or services, a move which would affect Apple and Google with their restrictive app store rules and payment.\\n\\nThe rules would also subject gatekeepers to annual audits of their advertising metrics and reporting practices.

The justices, who get to pick which cases they hear, also avoided taking up some contentious cases.\\n\\\"There is a concern that really big changes that are made without a full complement of justices may not been seen as legitimate. I hope the court will be similarly cautious during this period,\\\" said Deepak Gupta, a regular Supreme Court lawyer.\\nComplicating matters even further, the normally collegial court has been conducting its business remotely since March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nRepublican President Donald Trump has said he wants a nominee confirmed before the election on Nov. 3, when he is seeking a second term in a race against Democrat Joe Biden. He said on Monday he would make an announcement as early as this weekend, with appeals court judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa viewed as front-runners.\\nLooming on the horizon are Nov. 10 oral arguments in the latest challenge to Obamacare, a case in which Ginsburg s vote might have been crucial. The Supreme Court previously upheld the law, known officially as the Affordable Care Act, on a 5-4 vote in 2012. Ginsburg was one of the five justices in the majority then, which means that her absence could tilt the balance. \\nRepublican-led states and the Trump administration have asked the court to strike down the entire law, which is being defended by Democratic-led states and the House of Representatives. \\nThere is a strong chance the court will have to weigh in on election-related litigation, potentially even having a major say over which candidate ultimately wins.\\nSylvia Albert, director of voting and elections for Common Cause, a voting rights group, said Roberts would likely seek a compromise in such a situation because he is \\\"concerned with his legacy and trying to find a middle ground.\\\" \\nAny other emergency applications made at the court in the short term could also be affected by the lack of a ninth justice.\\nFor example, in a case that the court could act on at any time, the Trump administration has asked the justices to put on hold a federal judge s decision to block during the pandemic a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rule requiring women to visit a hospital or clinic to obtain a drug used for medication-induced abortions.\\nAbortion is one of the most divisive social issues facing the court and conservative activists want Trump to pick a nominee who will curb abortion rights, which Ginsburg repeatedly voted to uphold.\\nHIGH-STAKES CASES\\nWith Ginsburg s absence, the court s initial votes in cases argued in October could be 4-4, meaning that if a decision was issued, the lower court ruling would stand and no nationwide precedent would be set if that was the final outcome. The court would most likely order such a case to be reargued after the Senate confirms Ginsburg s successor. \\nAmong the cases being heard in the first week is a high-stakes software copyright dispute between Alphabet  Inc s Google and  Oracle Corp   that is potentially worth billions of dollars to the winner.\\nOther cases the court has taken up for its new term could also be affected. On Nov. 4, the justices consider a major legal fight over the scope of religious-rights exemptions to certain federal laws. The dispute concerns Philadelphia s decision to bar Catholic Social Services from participating in its foster-care program because the organization prohibited same-sex couples from serving as foster parents.\\n\\nThe court on Dec. 2 weighs a bid by the Democratic-led House to obtain material the Trump administration withheld from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\u2019s report on Russian political meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\"], [\"2020-09-22 00:00:00\", \"GOOGL\", -0.5, \"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/trump-to-meet-state-attorneys-general-to-discuss-key-us-tech-liability-shield-2302779\", \"By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to meet on Wednesday with a group of Republican state attorneys general about revising a key law that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users and allows them to remove lawful but objectionable posts.\\n\\\"Online censorship goes far beyond the issue of free speech, it\\u2019s also one of protecting consumers and ensuring they are informed of their rights and resources to fight back under the law,\\\" White House spokesman Judd Deere  said. \\\"State attorneys general are on the front lines of this issue and President Trump wants to hear their perspectives.\\\"\\nA person briefed on the matter said Trump is expected to meet with the state attorneys general of Texas, Arizona, Utah, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Missouri.\\nThe planned meeting was reported earlier by the Washington Post.\\nIn May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms  content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken the law, Section 230.\\nHe directed the Commerce Department to file the petition asking the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to limit protections under Section 230 after  Twitter Inc   warned readers in May to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.\\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai opened the petition to a 45-day public comment.\\nEarlier this month, the Republican state attorneys general \\nof Texas, Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri backed Trump\\u2019s push, arguing social media platforms cannot be truly free \\u201cunless the participants understand the rules of the forum, and competition is able to provide alternatives when speech restrictions go too far.\\u201d\\n\\nA group representing major internet companies including  Facebook Inc  , Amazon.com Inc  and Alphabet  Inc s Google urged the FCC to reject the petition, calling it \\\"misguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.\\\"\"], [\"2020-09-22 00:00:00\", \"GOOGL\", -0.7, \"https://www.investing.com/news/economy/chinese-tech-giant-tencents-wechat-app-sees-downloads-surge-before-us-ban-2302800\", \"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent s WeChat messaging app has seen a surge in downloads in the United States since Friday after Washington confirmed it would push ahead with a planned ban of the app, data showed on Tuesday.\\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce issued an order requiring Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc s Google to remove WeChat for downloads on national security grounds, but a U.S. judge blocked the move on Sunday.

They hurt China s national security, interests and dignity,\\\" the newspaper said in an editorial in its English edition published late on Monday. It was also carried in its Chinese edition.\\n\\\"From the information provided by the U.S., the deal was unfair. It caters to the unreasonable demands of Washington. It s hard for us to believe that Beijing will approve such an agreement,\\\" it said, echoing comments on Twitter the same evening from its editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin.\\nHu on Tuesday, responding to comments Trump made to Fox News about how TikTok Global was going to be \\\"totally controlled\\\" by Oracle, said on Twitter: \\\"Stop extorting. You think TikTok is a company from a small country?\\\"\\n\\\"There s no way the Chinese government will accept your demand. You can ruin TikTok s U.S. business, if U.S. users do not object, but you can t rob it and turn it into a U.S. baby.\\\"\\nThe Global Times is a tabloid published by the People s Daily, the official newspaper of China s ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and government unlike its parent publication.\\nChina s government has largely refrained from directly commenting on the deal s details, though the foreign ministry has said the United States should offer a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies.\\nReuters reported this month, citing sources, that Beijing opposed a forced sale of TikTok s U.S. operations by ByteDance, and would prefer to see the short video app shut down in the United States.\\nThe deal requires approval from regulators in both Beijing and Washington, ByteDance has said. China s Ministry of Commerce in late August revised a tech export control list that experts said would give it regulatory oversight over any TikTok deal.\\nByteDance and the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nMAIN OBJECTIONS\\nOver the weekend, ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart said they had reached a deal that would satisfy Trump s call for TikTok to be sold to an American firm or be shut down in the United States.\\nHowever, the sides have framed the deal differently in public statements.\\nWhereas ByteDance said it will majority-own TikTok Global, Oracle and Walmart together said ByteDance s ownership would be distributed to its investors - many of which are U.S.-based - and that ByteDance itself would have no direct stake. They also said four of TikTok Global s five-member board would be American.\\nThe unidentified author of the Global Times editorial objected to there being only one board seat reserved for a Chinese national, as well as the stipulated inclusion on the board of a U.S-approved \\\"national security director\\\".\\nIt also denounced the need for ByteDance to reveal source code to Oracle as part of the latter s role of \\\"trusted technology partner\\\" and criticised the likelihood of TikTok Global blocking Chinese access to its app. \\nTikTok has never been available in China. It has said it has more than 100 million monthly active U.S. users, compared with 600 million daily users at mainland equivalent Douyin.\\n\\\"As TikTok and Douyin should have the same source code, this means the U.S. can get to know the operations of Douyin,\\\" the Global Times said.\\n\\\"If the reorganization of TikTok under U.S. manipulation becomes a model, it means once any successful Chinese company expands its business to the U.S. and becomes competitive, it will be targeted by the U.S. and turned into a U.S.-controlled company via trickery and coercion, which eventually serves only U.S. interests.\\\"\\nBeijing-based ByteDance has only two Chinese nationals on its five-member board, with the other three being foreigners running U.S.-based companies.\\n\\nByteDance has also said Oracle s ability to inspect TikTok s source code before investing is akin to previous instances of U.S. companies such as  Microsoft Corp   sharing source code with Chinese technology experts.\"], [\"2020-09-22 00:00:00\", \"MSFT\", -0.5, \"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-whitbread-snaps-as-the-uk-signals-an-end-to-reopening-2302922\", \"By Geoffrey Smith \\nInvesting.com -- The specter of lockdowns is haunting Europe s stock markets again on Tuesday, after the U.K. effectively abandoned its campaign to get people back into offices in an effort to contain a rapidly-swelling second wave of the Covid-19 virus. \\nU.K. media reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge people to work from home wherever possible, on top of a new 10 PM curfew for pubs and restaurants. While the new measures fall short of what was feared, the unmistakable direction of travel is toward an extension of the extreme social distancing imposed back in the spring.\\nNo surprise then, that the stocks being hardest hit are those travel and leisure-related names that had started to show signs of life in the last few weeks: Ryanair , International Airlines Group   and Air France KLM  stock all fell by between 4% and 5%, while aerospace suppliers  Meggitt  , Senior  and Rolls-Royce  Holdings PLC  also all tumbled, the last of them hitting yet another new low for the year.\\nBy contrast, tech is back as the defensive play: payments company  Adyen   surged nearly 6% to a new record high, while SAP  rose 2.2% and games publisher Rovio  rose 2.2%, buoyed by the hefty $7.5 billion dished out by Microsoft  for the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, the author of Doom and other successful video game franchises.\\nBut if you want a peek into the course of the next six months, then take a look at  Whitbread , a U.K.-based operator of hotels and restaurants. It announced on Tuesday it will cut up to 18% of its workforce, some 6,000 jobs.  While optimists will point out that the government s shift of focus will only redirect economic activity rather than kill it, those job cuts - which look like a pre-emptive measure to avoid being saddled with the full cost of paying the workforce when the government s furlough scheme runs out, are part of an ever-clearer trend toward higher joblessness, lower tax revenue and higher government deficits.\\n\\\"It has been clear from the beginning of this crisis that even as restrictions are eased and hospitality businesses such as ours reopen their doors, that demand would be materially lower than FY20 levels for a period of time,\\\" the company said in a stock exchange statement, which also showed a 75% drop in revenue over the six months through August.  \\nGiven that the thinking behind that decision took place against an improving backdrop, the fact that the announcement coincides with the government reversing course on reopening the economy has basically killed any hopes that the job cuts could represent some kind of turning point.

ByteDance added that TikTok Global will become its subsidiary. \\nOracle and Walmart  Inc, which have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5% and 7.5% respectively, had said on Saturday that majority ownership of TikTok would be in American hands. On Monday, Oracle said ByteDance s ownership of TikTok would be distributed to ByteDance s investors, and that the Beijing-based firm would have no stake in TikTok Global.\\nTrump signed an executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to relinquish ownership of TikTok. Oracle s account of the deal would mean that ByteDance would be complying with that order, while ByteDance s account would represent a policy reversal for Trump.\\nTrump did not comment on the conflicting accounts of the agreement on Monday, but said the deal was \\\"working its way through\\\" after he granted his preliminary approval.\\n\\\"If we can save (TikTok), we will save it, and if we can t we will cut it off. We have to have total security,\\\" Trump told reporters before departing the White House. \\nThe corporate governance arrangement that the companies have disclosed for TikTok Global does not award total control to Oracle and Walmart. Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon would be one of five directors on TikTok Global s board, the companies have said. Others would include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, and the heads of ByteDance s two top investors, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. The fifth board director has yet to be named. \\nThe current plan for TikTok Global does not involve any transfer of algorithms or technologies, and Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok U.S. s source code, ByteDance said on Monday. This is akin to U.S. companies such as  Microsoft Corp   sharing their source code with Chinese technology experts, ByteDance added. Oracle and Walmart have said all of TikTok s technology will be transferred to TikTok Global. \\nThe Commerce Department postponed a ban on downloads and apps to the TikTok app that was due to take effect on Sunday by one week, to give the companies time to finalize the deal. \\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a U.S. government panel that reviews deals for potential national security risks, has been overseeing the negotiations.\\nSome sources close to the deal have sought to reconcile the discrepancies by pointing out that 41% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, so by counting this indirect ownership TikTok Global would be majority owned by U.S. parties. One of the sources said the deal with Oracle and Walmart values TikTok Global at more than $50 billion.\\nByteDance on Monday also confirmed plans for an initial public offering of TikTok Global. Oracle has said this will happen in less than 12 months on a U.S. stock exchange. \\nEDUCATION FUND\\nByteDance also said a $5 billion payment of taxes TikTok Global will make to the U.S. Treasury is based on estimated income and other taxes the company will need to pay over the next few years, and has nothing to do with the deal reached with Oracle and Walmart. \\nTrump last week had said there would be a $5 billion U.S. education fund as part of the deal, but ByteDance has said it was not aware of this. Walmart, Oracle and some ByteDance investors said they would sponsor an educational initiative for online courses for children in the suburbs and inner cities. \\nByteDance owning the majority of TikTok Global and the algorithms means that ByteDance is \\\"not out of the game\\\" and has avoided the worst-case scenario, China s state-run newspaper Global Times said in an editorial published on Sunday. \\nBut on Monday, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin tweeted: \\\"Based on what I know, Beijing won t approve current agreement between ByteDance, TikTok s parent company, and Oracle, Walmart, because the agreement would endanger China s national security, interests and dignity.\\\"\\n\\nChina s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"], [\"2020-09-21 00:00:00\", \"MSFT\", -0.23076923076923078, \"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stocks-lower-at-close-of-trade-dow-jones-industrial-average-down-184-2302641\", \"Investing.com \\u2013 U.S. stocks were lower after the close on Monday, as losses in the Basic Materials, Oil & Gas and Financials sectors led shares lower.\\nAt the close in NYSE, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.84% to hit a new 1-month low, while the S&P 500 index fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ Composite index lost 0.13%.\\nThe best performers of the session on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were Apple Inc , which rose 3.03% or 3.24 points to trade at 110.08 at the close.
